  abstract = {{This second edition (for a review of the first edition (1990), see
	Zbl 0703.93001) contains the following new items: \par 1) A chapter
	on nonlinear controllability on $R^p$ (the adopted language is not
	suitable for manifolds). Controllable and reachable sets to and from
	$x_0$ respectively have nonempty interior if a Lie algebra arising
	from vector fields defining the control system can be identified
	with $R^p$ at $x_0$. If in addition a defined reversibility condition
	holds, then $x_0$ belongs to the interior of the intersection of
	these two sets. Moreover, a criterion for complete controllability
	is obtained in this context. After devoting several pages to introduce
	and prove the Frobenius theorem, a converse to the first implication
	from above is provided when the conditions hold on possibly distinct
	open dense subsets of the state space. In the reviewer's opinion,
	it is unfortunate that the concept of strong accessibility and related
	criteria are not treated: it is an important situation in the gap
	between accessibility and controllability which provides deeper insight
	into what is going on. This information can be found in the book
	of {\it H. Nijmeijer} and {\it A. van der Schaft} [Nonlinear dynamical
	control systems (1990; Zbl 0701.93001)]. \par 2) A chapter is devoted
	to optimal control with constrained and unconstrained controls. The
	author obtains the extremum principle of Pontryagin and the Euler-Lagrange
	equation of the calculus of variations in a separate section. Another
	section deals with gradient-based numerical methods. \par 3) The
	minimum-time problem for linear systems is presented in a new chapter.
	The assumption is that the control set is convex and compact. The
	author shows that the reachability set in any time from any point
	is compact and convex through suitably defined weakly convergent
	sequences of control policies. Existence of an optimal control follows
	from the fact that the introduced reachability set is closed. The
	convexity of the reachability set is used to characterize final time
	optimal states on its boundary. This last situation is equivalent
	to an extremum principle and if an additional controllability type
	condition holds, the converse is true i.e. time-optimality is obtained
	from the boundary condition or the extremality principle. \par 4)
	A new section presents single input feedback linearization and nonlinear
	optimal stabilization is treated p. 390 via the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
	whose solution yields a value function for an optimization problem.
	This value function is a Lyapunov function. But this way of handling
	the problem is subject to plugging the right feedback in the Hamilton-Jacobi
	equation which will lead to a solution. Nonlinear stabilization is
	also introduced p. 239 where control Lyapunov functions and backstepping
	are presented. \par 5) Two sections deal with controllability in
	recurrent neural nets and controllability of linear systems with
	bounded controls. In the first case, the system is modelled by $$\dot
	x= \theta_n (Ax+Bu)$$ where $x\in R^n$ and $\theta_n$ is a diagonal
	mapping having each of its components acting as a saturation function
	modelled by the hyperbolic tangent. The main result is that local
	strong controllability around any state is equivalent to the condition
	that the rows of $B$ do not vanish nor do two rows coincide or are
	opposite. The result is obtained from a lemma interesting in its
	own sake: For the system $\dot x= f(x,u)$, if there is $x_0$ such
	that the origin belongs to the interior of the convex hull of the
	set of vectors $f(x_0,u)$ for $u$ in its admissible set, then there
	is a neighborhood of $x_0$ which is controllable to $x_0$ and reachable
	from $x_0$. The proof uses the analytic and asymptotic properties
	of the tangent hyperbolic function and is not trivial. In the case
	of bounded controls, it is shown that any point of the state space
	can be reached if and only if the system is controllable with an
	unstable drift. \par 6) The chapter on dynamic programming and $L-Q$
	problems has been revised. \par 7) ``Errors and typos have been corrected''
	(but there are some left) and a list of symbols has been added. \par
	This new edition gets closer to the impossible task of presenting
	a complete and rigorous panorama of control theory in a single book.
	It is one of the best source available with respect to these two
	qualities.}},
